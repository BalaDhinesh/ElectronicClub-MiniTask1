    • ATMEGA8 Microcontroller(to store data)
    • RFID Reader
    • RFID Tags
    • LCD display

RFID based attendance system consists of RFID Reader, RFID Tag, LCD display and microcontroller unit.

When the tag is placed near the reader, due to the induced mutual inductance energy, data is transferred to reader.
